# simple-calculator
  * This program is a simple yet versatile console-based calculator written in C++.
  * It supports a range of mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    Additional operations: square, square root, cube, modulus, exponentiation.
  * The code is designed with modularity, error handling for division by zero and modulus by zero.
  * Clean and modular design with a class-based structure.
  * Ideal for learning and practicing C++ programming, especially for beginners
  * User-friendly menu display and input validation.

Design:

Class-Based Structure:
    The calculator functionality is encapsulated within the Calculator class.
    
Switch-Case Statement:
   The main program uses a switch-case statement to determine the user's choice and execute the corresponding operation.
   
Private Helper Methods:
    Mathematical operations are implemented as private methods within the class, promoting encapsulation and code organization.
    
Menu Display Method:
    The displayMenu() method is responsible for displaying the menu to the user.
    
Input Validation:
     The program includes input validation to handle invalid choices from the user.
     
Error Handling:
     Division by zero is handled with an appropriate error message.
Modulus by zero is handled with an error message.

Looping Mechanism:
    The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit (option 10).
    
Output Formatting:
     The program provides clear and formatted output for the results of each operation.
     
Graceful Exit:
     The program exits gracefully with a thank-you message when the user chooses to exit.

                 THANK YOU !!!
